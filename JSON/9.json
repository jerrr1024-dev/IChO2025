TK contains the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate 1, a derivative of vitamin B1, in the active site. Breslow and coworkers studied cation 2, a model of cofactor 1, to demonstrate the relatively acidic properties of thiamine. Cation 2 underwent a single H/D exchange in D_{2}O, which yielded 4 via intermediate 3.",

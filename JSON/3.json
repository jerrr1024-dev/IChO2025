Some artificial \"molecular skyscrapers\" can be made through coordination chemistry of just two pieces: metal ions and organic ligands.\n\nIn these 3D structures, every vertex contains a square planar Pd(II) ion coordinated to four pyridine ligands. Along each edge is a bent organic ligand consisting of two pyridines linked together.\n\nThe angle between the two N->Pd bonds from the same ligand controls which structure forms. Larger angles give larger structures. Where free rotation around a bond is possible, the ligand adopts a conformation to form a structure with the smallest possible angle."

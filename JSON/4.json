Many of the world's top players, including Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray have won titles there. The composition of tennis balls has evolved over hundreds of years. To ensure a good bounce, the inside of modern tennis balls is pressurised above atmospheric pressure. However, old hollow tennis balls just contained air at atmospheric pressure. In this problem, assume tennis balls have an inner radius of R = 3.0 cm that remains constant throughout the pressurisation process. Assume that the composition of air is 20% O_{2} and 80% N_{2} by volume. Consider that overpressure does not expand the ball."

            "context": "Chemists then discovered how to pressurise a ball above atmospheric pressure using a reaction between compounds A and B, which forms gas C (to create additional inner pressure) plus other non-gaseous products. A capsule with a quantity  m_{mix} = 0.3389 g of a stoichiometric mixture of two white inorganic compounds A and B was placed inside a ball filled with air at atmospheric pressure. They reacted completely inside the ball upon heating to form gas C and other products (reaction 1) to produce an overall pressure inside the ball of p = 1.600 atm (at 25°C). Once this ball was opened, all residue inside was collected and dissolved in water. The dropping of silver nitrate in that solution gave a white precipitate (reaction 2). This collected precipitate could be partially dissolved in a concentrated aqueous solution of B. By increasing the pH of this mixture, the precipitate dissolved completely (reaction 3). If the same initial capsule of A+B is dissolved in water and concentrated solution of silver nitrate added,  m_{precipitate} = 0.8224 g of white precipitate formed which was approximately twice the mass of precipitate formed in reaction 2. When the capsule of A + B dissolved in a solution of HI the formation of gas D started, and the solution turned brown (reaction 4). Upon further addition of sodium thiosulfate this colour disappeared (reaction 5). The densities of gases C and D differ by no more than  10%. Write the chemical formulae of compounds A-D.

            "context": "The pressure inside modern tennis balls is p_{0} = 1.80 atm. They are sold in a pressurised can, with the same pressure in the can as in the ball to stop gas coming out during storage. Standard balls contain air and premium balls contain pure N_{2}. Once the can is opened, depressurisation begins, and the gas diffuses out of the balls until the internal pressure reaches atmospheric pressure. Assume there is no diffusion of gas into the balls at any point. The activation energy for the depressurisation of a premium ball is  E_{A} = 50.0 kJ mol^{-1}. The rate of ball depressurisation (pressure/time) could be described by similar equations of those used in chemical kinetics. At T_{0} = 25.0°C, once the can is opened, the premium balls depressurise to p_{1} = 1.40 atm after t_{1} = 241 h and to p_{2} = 1.19 atm after about t_{2} = 21 days. The initial depressurisation rate of regular balls is 10% faster than premium balls. Demonstrate that the depressurisation process follows the first kinetic order by calculating the depressurisation rate constant k_{N_2} for N_{2} in h^{-1}. Note: If you couldn't calculate the answer, use $k_{N_2} = 10^{-3} h^{-1}$  in further calculations. Calculate the (depressurisation) rate constant k_{O_{2}} for O_{2} in h^{-1}, assuming the rates for both gases are additive. As well as today being the IChO 2025 theory paper, it is also (perhaps less importantly) the Semi-Finals day at Wimbledon. Amanda Anisimova will start a match in t_{match} = 12.0 h from now. The weather today in Wimbledon is predicted to be a constant  T_{W} = 30.0 °C. Assume a new set of premium balls, which were manufactured and placed in the can at T_{0} = 25.0 °C, are opened now and quickly change to T_{W} = 30.0 °C. Calculate the pressure p_{start} (in atm) of the balls at the start of the match."

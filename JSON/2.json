            "context": "Whilst stereochemical control is challenging synthetically, the biological synthesis controls stereochemistry elegantly through an assembly line of various enzymes. The carbon chain is built up through the addition of monomers. These units are connected via a thioester to Coenzyme A (CoA). The functions of the various enzymes and proteins are shown in the table. The first part of the assembly line is shown with blanks. The enzymes are shown in circles and act in the order of the arrow. Draw in the hexagons the structure of the monomer needed by the enzyme AT at each of the points numbered 1-4. Carbon dioxide is released when the monomers are incorporated. The monomers have the following general structure where the R group is anionic. Fill in each circle with the abbreviations of enzyme(s) needed. Write X if no additional enzyme is needed. Complete the rectangles with the structure of the growing molecule attached to the enzyme.",
